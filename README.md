# UfedPro

**UfedPro** is a mobile malware detection prototype developed during a prestigious Cybersecurity Hackathon organized by the Delhi Police West District, where it secured third place. This project showcases expertise in mobile security and malware detection.

## Overview

UfedPro is designed to enhance mobile security through two primary features:

1. **Link Safety Checker**: 
   - When a link is clicked, it is checked against a database to determine its safety. 
   - If the link is deemed safe, it is opened in the browser. 

2. **Device Monitoring**: 
   - Continuously tracks the device to assess its security status.
   - Alerts the user if any potential threats or vulnerabilities are detected.

## Features

- **Real-time Link Checking**: 
   - Ensures that links are verified for safety before being opened.
   
- **Ongoing Device Security Monitoring**: 
   - Regularly checks the device for any security issues or malware.
   
- **User Alerts**: 
   - Provides notifications if any unsafe links or security threats are detected.

## Usage

- **Link Safety Checking**:
  - Click on any link. UfedPro will automatically check the link's safety and open it if it's secure.
